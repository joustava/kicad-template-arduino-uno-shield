# Arduino Uno template project for KiCad EDA

> This is a KiCad [template](https://docs.kicad.org/5.1/en/kicad/kicad.html#project_templates) to quickstart project hats for Arduino Uno. It is created according to the KiCad [documentation](https://docs.kicad.org/5.1/en/kicad/kicad.html#creating_templates) on templates. There are probably better versions somewhere on the internets or even one build in however, I wanted to get some more KiCad experience, so here you go!
